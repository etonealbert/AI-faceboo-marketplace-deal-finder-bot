**Repository Name:**
AI Facebook Marketplace Deal Finder Bot

**Description:**
This repository contains the implementation of an AI-powered bot designed to automate the process of finding the best deals on Facebook Marketplace, particularly for vehicles such as cars and motorcycles. The bot is capable of searching listings based on flexible criteria, negotiating with sellers, and evaluating deals' profitability using market data. Key features include:

1. **Advanced Search:** Filters listings by type (e.g., car, motorcycle), brand, model, price range, year, mileage, and more.
2. **Real-Time Notifications:** Alerts users about new listings that match their criteria.
3. **Old Listing Processing:** Sends automated messages to sellers of older listings with discounted offers.
4. **Deal Evaluation:** Uses KBB market data to assess the competitiveness of the listing and provides a profitability score.
5. **Negotiation:** Interacts with sellers to ask follow-up questions, gather contact details, and discuss terms.
6. **Daily Reports:** Sends users a summary of the day's findings, including links, images, and pricing analysis.
7. **User Interface:** A simple interface for managing search criteria and bot settings.

**Technical Requirements:**
- Integration with Facebook Marketplace API or automation tools.
- Market analysis with KBB.com data for price comparison.
- AI-driven communication with sellers (e.g., using OpenAI GPT models).
- Secure data transmission and user account protection.

The project aims to save time and money by automating the search and negotiation process on Facebook Marketplace.
